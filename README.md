# Classification of Higgs Boson
####

Higgs Boson Classification project for the Machine Learning course CS-433 at EPFL (first mini-project).

Repository which stores the submission of `Pleutre` team in the 2020 edition of the [EPFL Machine Learning Higgs Boson Competition on AICrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs/).

Our submission scored 56 out of 300 participants.

Note that the final ranking is not accurate since we were restricted to only use regression methods to perform classification (high accuracy was not achievable) but top ranking people cheated and used SVM methods in the end.
